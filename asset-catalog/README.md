# Asset Catalog Assignment

*This assignment will simulate the various tasks around storing assets in a distributed system. For all intents and purposes, the assets mentioned above could be of any type: audio, images, videos, text-data, binary-data, etc. The goal of the assignment is to upload assets from any number of remote clients to a centralized server for persistent storage. The server is responsible for the storage of the actual data that represents the asset, as well as the metadata that describes the data.*

## How to use?

First build the docker image

```cmd
docker build -t <YOUR-IMAGE-NAME> .
```

And that you can run it

```cmd
docker run --name <YOUR-CONTAINER-NAME> <YOUR-IMAGE-NAME>
```

Good Luck!!ðŸ˜˜
